simple_lstm.ipynb:
Just a simple lstm neural network to perform some testing

submission_kernel:
- text preprocessing functions (punctuation, special characters, mispelled words etc..) 
- averaging embeddings (GloVe and Paragram) to improve results
- combining different recurrent neural network architectures: GRU, LSTM, CNN
- Simple ensembling by averaging the predictions
